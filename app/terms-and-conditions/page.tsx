              By accessing or using tradersmarket.io (the "Site"), and purchasing any products offered, you agree to the following Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              1. Use at Your Own Risk
            </h2>
            <p>
              The software products (MT5 Expert Advisors or "bots") offered on this site are for educational and informational purposes only.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are not investment advice, not a guarantee of profits, and not a substitute for independent financial decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are solely responsible for how you use any bot or strategy purchased from us. Trading carries risk, and past performance does not guarantee future results.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              2. No Financial Advice
            </h2>
            <p>
              We are not a licensed financial advisor, broker, or investment firm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing on this website — including written content, bots, or communication — should be interpreted as financial advice, recommendation, or endorsement of any specific trading strategy or instrument.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
              When you purchase our bots, you receive a license for personal use only.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may not copy, share, resell, or distribute our software without written permission.

            </h2>

              Due to the digital nature of our products, all sales are final.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not offer refunds once a product has been delivered. If you experience a technical issue, we will make reasonable efforts to help.

              5. No Guarantee of Results
            </h2>
            <p>
              We make no guarantees or promises about the performance of any bot.
            </p>
