              Not all trading strategies work for every trader. The same applies to trading bots: the best results come when you match the bot's logic to your own trading style. Before you commit to using an automated system, it's worth understanding whether a trend-following bot, a reversal bot, or a breakout bot aligns with how you approach the markets.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              Trend-Following Bots
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>How they work:</strong> Trend-following bots are designed to ride sustained moves in the market. They often use tools like moving averages (e.g., EMA crossovers) or momentum indicators (e.g., RSI confirmations) to identify the direction of the trend and stay with it until the market shows signs of reversing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best for:</strong> Traders who prefer a patient, steady approach and don't mind holding positions for longer periods. Trend-following works best in markets with strong directional moves (e.g., after major news or in trending forex pairs).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Key advantage:</strong> When markets trend cleanly, trend-following bots can capture large moves with relatively little noise.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              Reversal (Mean Reversion) Bots
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>How they work:</strong> Reversal bots look for points where the market is likely to turn back, often using Bollinger Bands, RSI overbought/oversold signals, or Fibonacci retracements as entry triggers. The logic is simple: markets don't move in one direction forever, so these bots try to profit from short-term corrections.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best for:</strong> Traders who like quick trades and value consistency over big wins. Reversal bots can work well in range-bound or choppy markets where trends don't extend far.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Key advantage:</strong> They generate frequent signals and can provide smoother equity curves when the market is not strongly trending.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              Breakout Bots
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>How they work:</strong> Breakout bots watch for price to push beyond key support or resistance levels. A daily breakout strategy, for example, sets trades when price moves outside the prior day's high or low. These bots aim to catch the explosive momentum that often follows a breakout.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Best for:</strong> Traders who enjoy high-energy market moves and are comfortable with volatility. Breakout bots are well suited for fast movers like gold, indices, or currency pairs during major sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Key advantage:</strong> They can capture rapid gains in a short time, making them ideal for traders who want more action.
            </p>

              Choosing the Right Bot for You
            </h2>
            <p>
              The right bot depends less on the "best" strategy and more on your own preferences:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
              <li>Do you like patience and long trends? → Trend-following bots.</li>
              <li>Do you prefer frequent trades with controlled risk? → Reversal bots.</li>
              <li>Do you thrive on fast, explosive moves? → Breakout bots.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              By aligning your bot choice with your trading style, you not only improve your results but also make it easier to stick with the system through inevitable drawdowns.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-8">
