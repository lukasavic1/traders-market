              Most traders spend the majority of their time searching for the "perfect" strategy—whether it's an EMA crossover, RSI divergence, or Fibonacci retracement. But the hard truth is this: even the most sophisticated strategy will fail if you don't manage risk correctly. In fact, risk management often makes the difference between a trader who survives in the markets and one who blows up their account.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              The Role of Stop-Loss and Take-Profit
            </h2>
            <p>
              A stop-loss isn't just a safety net—it's your survival tool. By defining in advance how much you're willing to risk on a single trade, you protect yourself from emotional decisions when the market moves against you. Similarly, take-profit levels lock in gains before the market has a chance to reverse. Together, stop-loss and take-profit orders create the framework for disciplined, repeatable trading.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              Why ATR-Based Filters Matter
            </h2>
            <p>
              Volatility changes constantly, and so should your risk controls. The Average True Range (ATR) is one of the most effective tools for adapting to market conditions. Using ATR-based stop-loss or position-sizing methods ensures that you don't risk the same amount in a quiet market as you do in a highly volatile one. This dynamic approach keeps your risk consistent, regardless of conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
              The Risk/Reward Ratio
            </h2>
            <p>
              Professional traders don't measure trades only by win rate. Instead, they focus on the risk/reward ratio—how much potential profit a trade offers compared to its potential loss. A strategy with a 40% win rate can still be profitable if the average winner is two or three times larger than the average loser. By building trades around favorable risk/reward ratios, you tilt the math in your favor over the long run.

              Why Risk &gt; Strategy
            </h2>
            <p>
              Strategies come and go. Market conditions shift. What worked last year may stop working tomorrow. But risk management principles are timeless. A disciplined approach to controlling losses and protecting capital allows you to stay in the game long enough for your edge to play out. Without it, even the best setups turn into costly mistakes.
